"""Recovery Manager: agent entry point.

Round 3 Recovery Manager implementation for Pod 6.
Owner: @hayth31 (Haytham / Hayth)

Recovery Manager evaluates fee charges against accumulated upstream evidence from
Receiving, Prep, Pack, and Returns stages.

Check semantics for Recovery:
  CONTRADICTS -> FAIL  (evidence refutes the fee charge -> claim recommended)
  SUPPORTS    -> PASS  (evidence confirms the fee charge was justified -> no claim)
  SILENT      -> UNCERTAIN (evidence is silent / missing -> cannot claim)

Rules:
1. Tenancy check: refuse unknown subjects for org.
2. Inbound defect fee: refute if Prep/Receiving evidence shows compliance.
3. Refund item not returned: refute if Returns evidence confirms item returned.
4. Weight-tier fees: mark SILENT due to lack of upstream measured dimensions (F-07).
5. Lost inbound: mark SILENT due to supplier vs channel loss separation (F-10).
6. Zero-amount fees: mark SILENT (F-09).
